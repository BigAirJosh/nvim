# My Neovim configuration:

I have no shame in admitting, this Neovim configuration is based of the
excellent [nvim-lua/kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

I originally started my Neovim journey using the also excellent
[LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/). I can't speak highly enough of this
setup for, "out of the box" defaults that "just work".  This has influenced a
good deal of my key bindings such as `<leader>l_` as a Language Server prefix
or `<leader>s_` for Telescope search prompts.

## TODO:

- [x] add vim-dispatch plugin
- [x] migrate plugins from init.lua to plugins directory
- [x] remap keybindings to feel more like LunarVim
- [x] create an options.lua config
- [x] create a keymaps.lua config
- [ ] cleanup plugins and custom config
- [ ] configure debug plugin
- [ ] checkout oil plugin


and lets take a look at monitor wobble when the PC is off the desk?!
not sure, what do you think?

and how about now with the monitor back on the desck. Actually I think this might be a little less :D
