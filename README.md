# My Neovim configuration

I have no shame in admitting, this Neovim configuration is based of the
excellent [nvim-lua/kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

I originally started my Neovim journey using the also excellent
[LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/). I can't speak highly enough of this
setup for, "out of the box" defaults that "just work".  This has influenced a
good deal of my key bindings such as `<leader>l_` as a Language Server prefix
or `<leader>s_` for Telescope search prompts.

## TODO:

- [x] add vim-dispatch plugin
- [ ] migrate plugins from init.lua to plugins directory
- [ ] remap keybindings to feel more like LunarVim
- [ ] create an options.lua config
- [ ] create a keymaps.lua config
